The purpose of this challenge was to create visuals using hvplot, analyze the data from the visuals generated and provide a recommendation based on the data on where Proptech can use the stragey of buying property and immediately renting the property. 

## Technologies

This project leverages python 3.7 specifically and assumes that jupyter lab has been installed.  in the root directory. In additon, you would need to have the following modules installed:
* pandas
* hvplot

## Resources
* Data provided by Columbia FinTech program.

## Contributions 

Historical data and challenge questions provided by Columbia FinTech progam.
Analysis, code, and conclusions completed by Sean Senhouse

## Installation Guide
### To review challenge 6:

* First initialze the dev environment and the Jupyter lab by typing the following at the command prompt:  

```python
str("conda activate dev")
str("jupyter lab")
```
* Open the Jupter Notebook titled: **san_francisco_housing.ipynb** 

* Run all of the code

## Usage
The code imports the data from csv files. The code then generates the following charts:
